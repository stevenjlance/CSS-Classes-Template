# CSS Classes Template

Clone this lab down, and follow along as you see a few different ways of styling multiple elements in similar ways.

## Part 1: Classes

Style the elements in `classes.html` by writing rulesets with class selectors in the `classes.css` file.

## Part 2: IDs

Style the elements in `ids.html` by writing rulesets with ID selectors in the `ids.css` file.
